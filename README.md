# Elite Personal Trainers

The main aim of my project is a very simple and concise one; to create a site where anyone on **any stage** of their fitness
journey, can find a personal trainer for **them**. I gained inspiration for this project from personal experience, especially my love of fitness.
I feel there is a need for this project, to be able to go on to a website, and have multiple programs available to you. I feel there are not many websites that have 
personal trainers who all specialise in certain fields.

As previously mentioned, this website's target market is anyone interested in fitness, from aspiring athletes to someone completely new to the gym.

## UX
 I aim to do this by creating a website which is both easy to navigate and user friendly. The site will have a minimalistic feel, in the sense that I won't bombard potential clients with too much information.
I aim to provide just the key information needed for potential clients, from services we provide, to testimonials for them to read. And most importantly, a section where they can provide more details, in regards to their goals and previous experience with fitness.

The site will feature different personal trainers, with different skill sets.
This will provide variety, which will ultimately lead to more clients and thus higher revenue.

### Colour and Typography
In regards to the design, I opted for a simple colour scheme. The main colours are black, white and a specific shade of orange. Additionally on the hover effect there is a shade of yellow for the contact page.
For the typography, I opted to use Cairo and sans serif as a substitute if Cairo did not work.

### User Stories

#### Potential Client
- As a potential client, I want to be able to easily go to a section and read testimonials from other clients which highlight their experiences, so that I can get more insight into how good the services are. 
  This will help me decide if I want to sign up with this company.
- As a potential client, I want to be able to see what programs you offer and the trainers credentials, so that I can see whether you offer what I am looking for.
- As a potential client, I want to be able to contact you and start consultation, so that I can sign up for training.

#### Business Owner
- As the business owner, I want to add a section with a contact form, so that I can entice clients to contact us. This will lead to more potential sales, as a result more revenue.
- As the business owner, I want the site to be easy to navigate and user friendly, this will lead to potential clients having a good user experience.
- As the business owner, I want to provide key information about our company in terms of history and reviews (testimonials), so that I can show any potential client that we are a reputable business, with proven results.
- As the business owner, I want our social media links to be clear at the bottom of the page, this will lead to more activity on our pages, which is great for the business.

#### An ElitePT trainer
- As one of the 'Elite Personal Trainers', I want to have my accreditation shown on the website, so that I can get more people to hire me.

### Wireframes
Here is the link to my original <a href="https://github.com/Ladev25/Ladev25.github.io/blob/master/wireframes/MS1.pdf" target="_blank">Wireframes</a>. I have
created a wireframe for each feature, additionally I have also created a wireframe for both mobile and desktop view. These wireframes were made at the start of my project, which is
why they may be slighlty different to my website, which I have modified over time.


## Features
On my website, there are a total of 6 features. Below I will discuss each briefly, and state it's purpose. 

### Existing Features
1. Navigation bar: This allows user to easily navigate the page and get to whichever section they want. To do this, they simplify
   click on the relevant section on the navigation bar.
1. Programs: This allows potential clients to see what services we offer, which will help them decide which one to pick. By offering these, 
   it highlights our varied services.
1. Personal Trainers: In this section we highlight the members of our team, and a brief background, this allows users to make a more
   informed decision, as to who to go with for personal training.
1. Testimonials: Allows potential clients to read how other clients feel about the service the company has offered. Thus giving legitimacy to the business and credibility.
1. Contact Form: Allows potential clients to start consultation, they do this by filling out the form and submitting it, alongside their name and email.
1. Footer: This contains our social media links in the form of icons. Which allows users to check out our social media pages, and contact us.


### Future Features
In future I would make a few additions. 

- I would have a drop down section where you can click on each personal trainer, from there you would be 
able to see videos of them training clients and a short clip where they introduce themselves. 
- I would also like to add more features to the site, for example the 
addition of a nutrition section. Where we can promote programs that include diets and foods to eat etc.
- In future, the addition of a log in section for our members would be great.
- Possibly expand the site to have multiple pages, as opposed to just one page.
- When the contact form has been submitted, for a message to appear that states it has been sent succesfully. And that we will contact them back within a time frame.

## Technologies Used
Here is a list of all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that I have used to construct my project. 

1. <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Git Hub</a>: Used to create the repository and where you push your code to. Used for deployment and version control.

1. <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/" target="_blank">Git Pod</a>: Used to write the code and style and where you push your code to Github.

1. HTML and CSS: For these two I could not find the official websites, which is why I have not provided a link. I used HTML for the structure of the page and CSS to style the page.

1. <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Javascript</a>:
The project uses Bootstrap JS scripts to be able to use the dropdown menu on the navigation bar. The drop down menu is active on the smaller screens.

1. <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>:
I used Bootstrap to code most of the website. Firsty, to structure the layout of the page, by using the container, rows and columns feature.
Secondly, for the responsive navigation bar, and the collapse to a dropdown menu. Thirdly, for the images to be placed in cards, as can be seen on the trainers feature, and lastly for the forms.

1. <a href="https://cdnjs.com/" target="_blank">Cdnjs</a>:
Cdnjs provided the library for the hover over effects on the navigation bar.

1. <a href="https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/" target="_blank"> Ian Lunn's Hover site</a>:
Used this in conjunction with the Cdnjs to pick the right hover effect for my project.

1. <a href="https://www.freeformatter.com/" target="_blank">FreeFormatter</a>:
This technically did not help me create the project, however I used this website to format both my HTML and CSS code. This will make it easier for anyone reading my code in the future.

1. <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a>:
Google Fonts provided the font for my website. I used Cairo, with different font weights.

1. <a href="https://balsamiq.com/" target="_blank">Balsamiq</a>: Used to create my initial wireframes at the start of the project.


## Testing
I have only conducted manual tests, having spoken to Tutor support, automated testing is not required for this milestone project. For each of the below tests, I have tested using **Chrome developer tools**, tested all
screen sizes available and different devices by clicking **Inspect** elements. Including the following below;

1. Moto G4
1. Galaxy S5
1. Pixel 2
1. Pixel 2 XL
1. iPhone 5/SE
1. iPhone 6/7/8
1. iPhone X
1. iPad
1. iPad Pro

The site functions correctly on all formats, I have tested this on multiple devices, including my MacBook Pro and a chromebook too. **All user stories have been tested and all meet expections**.

The site has also been tested on the following browsers;

- Chrome 
- Safari
- Mozilla Firefox 
- Opera 

The only visible difference seems to be when hosting on **Opera**, where the page height seems to be different. This is visible on the contact page, where there is not as large a margin-bottom on the footer.

Additionally, having used <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">WC3</a>, my HTML code showed up as having no errors. Plus when I used <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" target="_blank">WC3 (CSS)</a>, it also showed that I had no errors in my CSS code.

#### Hover effects:
 If you hover over the navbar, each section will turn to a shade of orange, and have a hover effect that makes it change size slighlty. Additionally, if you hover over any of the social media icons, it will have the same effect of changing size.

#### Navigation Bar:

- If you click on ElitePT, this will essentially take you to the landing page and refresh the website. 
- When you click on each of the other sections; Program, Trainers, Testimonials and Contact Us. It will redirect you to the relevant section on the page.

#### Contact Form:

- I tried to submit the empty form and you get a message telling you to enter your first name first.
- If you then attempt to submit with only first name entered, you will get an error message telling you to enter your surname.
- If the email section is left empty or entered incorrectly (without an @), an error message appears telling you to enter it correctly.
- Lastly, if you attempt to leave the message section empty and submit, you will get the relevant error message. The message states 'Please fill in this field'.
- If everything is entered correctly, the page will reload to suggest it has been submitted succesfully.

#### Footer Page:
 - By clicking on any of the social media icons, it will redirect you to the relevant page on a separate tab. This is because I have added the 'target_blank' to all links.


### Different Screen Sizes
One of the reasons I decided to use Bootstrap to create this project, was the mobile-first principle and especially the responsiveness. Using the layout meant that, as the screen size 
increases and decreases, the page responds accordingly. Below is the effects of changing the screen size (**in regards to screen width**);

#### Navigation Bar
- The navigation will collapse down to a dropdown menu when the screen is 575px and below.

#### Programs and Trainers
- The images and the adjoined text will be viewed differently depending on the screen size. So on a screen size of 992px and above, all four images will be aligned (on one line).
For screens where it is between 576px and below, one image will occupy one row. For screen sizes between 568px and 991px, it will show two images per row.

#### Testimonials
- For this section, the testimonials will be one testimonial per row for screen sizes 767px and below. For screens that are 768px and above it will show two testimonials on each row.

#### Contact Page
- Lastly, for the contact page, on screens 768px and above the contact form and the relevant text will be side by side (col-6 and col-6). But on smaller devices (767px and below) it will show the 
relevant text above the contact form. As for the social media icons, on all screens sizes above 368px, the icons will appear on one line. But for screens 368px and below, the last icon goes on a separate row. 

## Issues

#### Issues Fixed
- When running my code through a validator, one of the errors I received was, my comments had too many hyphens. I have now corrected this, and placed only two hyphens on either side of my comment.
- When loading my page, some images would take much longer to load then others. I quickly realised the photos were too large, so I resized them proportionately using **adjust size** under tools on Mac.
- In regards to my contact form, when I left the Full name field empty, I would not get an error message. I fixed this by going onto Bootstrap and adding the relevant invalidator code to my contact form.


#### Issues Pending
- For the collapsed dropdown menu, when you click on an option, the drop down menu section does not go back to it's original state automatically. You have to click on
the hamburger icon again for it collapse back.
- If I try to push the navigation bar more centrally, the options on the drop down menu seem to be pushed out of the menu section. Which is why I have left it as originally from the bootstrap page.
- When I click on the relevant feature on my navigation bar, ideally I would want to be redirected to the header of that feature. However, on mine it takes you to the text on that section.
- When you submit the contact form correctly, the URL changes and the page reloads. Having spoke to my mentor, I have been made aware that this can be fixed through the use of Javascript. However seeing 
as that is outside the scope of this project, I have added this to future features I would like to add.


## Deployment
To deploy my project, I took the following steps.

### Deploying via Github (Available to repository owner only)

1. To publish the project go on to the **Github Pages**.
1. The go on to the **repository** in Github and select the **settings** tab.
1. From there if you scroll down to the Github Pages section and in the source dropdown, select **none** for source and then select **"master branch"**.
1. The page then reloaded. When you then scroll down to the GitHub Pages section again, you'll see a message that states that was **site is ready to be published**, with a link.
1. If you open this link, it will take you to your site. 
1. Should take no longer than a minute on average.
1. However, if after 10 minutes, the link doesn't work, try to repeat the process again (selecting **none** for source, then selecting **master branch**).

### Running Locally (Available to anyone)

1. Go to the **GitHub pages**.
1. Go to the relevant **repository**.
1. Select the '**Clone or Download**' dropdown.
1. Then **Download Zip**.
1. Once downloaded, if you click on it, you will be taken to the **downloaded folder**.
1. When you open the folder, you will need to open the **index.html**.
1. Now you should see the project site on your desktop.
