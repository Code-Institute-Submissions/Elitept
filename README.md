# Elite Personal Trainers

The main aim of my project is a very simple and concise one; to create a site where anyone on **any stage** of their fitness
journey, can find a personal trainer for **them**. 

...
## UX
 
I aim to do this by creating a website which is both easy to navigate and user friendly. The site will have all the key information needed for potential clients, from services we provide, to testimonials for them to read. And most importantly, a section where they can provide more details, in regards to their goals and previous experience with fitness.

The site will feature different personal trainers, with different skill sets.
This will provide variety, which will ultimately lead to more clients and thus higher revenue.

### User Stories

- As a potential client, I want to be able to read testimonials from other clients which highlight their experiences, so that I can get more insight into how good the services are. 
  This will help me decide if I want to sign up with this company.
- As a potential client, I want to be able to see what services you offer and your credentials, so that I can see whether you offer what I am looking for.
- As the website owner, I want to add a section with a contact form, so that I can entice clients to contact us. This will lead to more potential sales, as a result more revenue.
- As the website owner, I want to provide key information about our company in terms of history and reviews, so that I can show any potential client that we are a reputable business, with proven results.
- As one of the 'Elite Personal Trainers', I want to have my accreditation shown on the website, so that I can get more people to hire me.

### Wireframes
Here is a link to the wireframes which I have created as part of my project.

## Features

On my website, there are a total of 6 features. Below I will discuss each briefly, and state it's purpose. 

### Existing Features

1. Navigation bar: This allows user to easily navigate the page and get to whichever section they want. To do this, they simplify
   click on the relevant section on the navigation bar.
1. Services: This allows potential clients to see what services we offer, which will help them decide which one to pick. By offering these, 
   it highlights our varied services.
1. Personal Trainers: In this section we highlight the members of our team, and a brief background, this allows users to make a more
   informed decision, as to who to go with for personal training.
1. Testimonials: Allows potential clients to read how other clients feel about the service the company has offered. Thus giving legitimacy to the business and credibility.

1. Footer: This contains our social media links in the form of icons. Which allows users to check out our social media pages, and contact us.


### Future Features

In future I would make a few additions. Firstly, I would have a drop down section where you can click on each personal trainer, from there you would be 
able to see videos of them training clients and a short clip where they introduce themselves. Secondly, I would like to add more features to the site, for example the 
addition of a nutrition section.
