# Elite Personal Trainers

The main aim of my project is a very simple and concise one; to create a site where anyone on **any stage** of their fitness
journey, can find a personal trainer for **them**. 

...
## UX
 
I aim to do this by creating a website which is both easy to navigate and user friendly. The site will have all the key information needed for potential clients, from services we provide, to testimonials for them to read. And most importantly, a section where they can provide more details, in regards to their goals and previous experience with fitness.

The site will feature different personal trainers, with different skill sets.
This will provide variety, which will ultimately lead to more clients and thus higher revenue.

### User Stories

- As a potential client, I want to be able to read testimonials from other clients which highlight their experiences, so that I can get more insight into how good the services are. 
  This will help me decide if I want to sign up with this company.
- As a potential client, I want to be able to see what services you offer and your credentials, so that I can see whether you offer what I am looking for.
- As the website owner, I want to add a section with a contact form, so that I can entice client to contact us. This will lead to more potential sales, as a result more revenue.
- As the website owner, I want to provide key information about our company and its history, so that I can show any potential client that we are a reputable business, with proven results.
- As one of the 'Elite Personal Trainers', I want to have my accreditation shown on the website, so that I can get more people to hire me.
