# Elite Personal Trainers

The main aim of my project is a very simple and concise one; to create a site where anyone on **any stage** of their fitness
journey, can find a personal trainer for **them**. 

I aim to do this by creating a website which is both easy to navigate and user friendly. The site will have all the key information
needed for potential clients, from services we provide, to testimonials for them to read. And most importantly, a section
where they can provide more details, in regards to their goals and previous experience with fitness.

 The site will feature different personal trainers, with different skill sets.
This will provide variety, which will ultimately lead to more clients and thus higher revenue.
