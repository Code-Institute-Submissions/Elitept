# Elite Personal Trainers

The main aim of my project is a very simple and concise one; to create a site where anyone on **any stage** of their fitness
journey, can find a personal trainer for **them**. I gained inspiration for this project from personal experience, especially my love of fitness.
I feel there is a need for this project, to be able to go on to a website, and have multiple programs available to you. I feel there are not many websites that have 
personal trainers who all specialise in one particular field.

As previously mentioned, this website's target market is anyone interested in fitness, from aspiring athletes to someone completely new to the gym.



## UX
 
I aim to do this by creating a website which is both easy to navigate and user friendly. The site will have a minimalistic feel, in the sense that I won't bombard potential clients with too much information.
I aim to provide just the key information needed for potential clients, from services we provide, to testimonials for them to read. And most importantly, a section where they can provide more details, in regards to their goals and previous experience with fitness.

The site will feature different personal trainers, with different skill sets.
This will provide variety, which will ultimately lead to more clients and thus higher revenue.

### User Stories

- As a potential client, I want to be able to read testimonials from other clients which highlight their experiences, so that I can get more insight into how good the services are. 
  This will help me decide if I want to sign up with this company.
- As a potential client, I want to be able to see what services you offer and your credentials, so that I can see whether you offer what I am looking for.
- As the business owner, I want to add a section with a contact form, so that I can entice clients to contact us. This will lead to more potential sales, as a result more revenue.
- As the business owner, I want to provide key information about our company in terms of history and reviews, so that I can show any potential client that we are a reputable business, with proven results.
- As one of the 'Elite Personal Trainers', I want to have my accreditation shown on the website, so that I can get more people to hire me.

### Wireframes
Here is the link to my <a href="https://github.com/Ladev25/Ladev25.github.io/blob/master/wireframes/MS1.pdf" target="_blank">Wireframes</a>. I have
created a wireframe for each feature, additionally I have also created a wireframe for both mobile and desktop view. These wireframes were made at the start of my project, which is
why they are different to my website, which I have modified over time.


## Features

On my website, there are a total of 6 features. Below I will discuss each briefly, and state it's purpose. 

### Existing Features

1. Navigation bar: This allows user to easily navigate the page and get to whichever section they want. To do this, they simplify
   click on the relevant section on the navigation bar.
1. Programs: This allows potential clients to see what services we offer, which will help them decide which one to pick. By offering these, 
   it highlights our varied services.
1. Personal Trainers: In this section we highlight the members of our team, and a brief background, this allows users to make a more
   informed decision, as to who to go with for personal training.
1. Testimonials: Allows potential clients to read how other clients feel about the service the company has offered. Thus giving legitimacy to the business and credibility.
1. Contact Form: Allows potential clients to start consultation, they do this by filling out the form and submitting it, alongside their name and email.
1. Footer: This contains our social media links in the form of icons. Which allows users to check out our social media pages, and contact us.


### Future Features

In future I would make a few additions. 

- I would have a drop down section where you can click on each personal trainer, from there you would be 
able to see videos of them training clients and a short clip where they introduce themselves. 
- I would also like to add more features to the site, for example the 
addition of a nutrition section. Where we can promote programs that include diets and foods to eat etc.
- In future, the addition of a log in section for our members would be great.
- Possibly expand the site to have multiple pages, as opposed to just one page.

## Technologies Used
Here is a list of all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that I have used to construct my project. 


1. HTML and CSS: For these two I could not find the official websites, which is why I have not provided a link. I used HTML for the structure of the page and CSS to style the page.

1. <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Javascript</a>:
The project uses Bootstrap JS scripts to be able to use the dropdown menu on the navigation bar. The drop down menu is active on the smaller screens.

1. <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>:
I used Bootstrap to code most of the website. Firsty, to structure the layout of the page, by using the container, rows and columns feature.
Secondly, for the responsive navigation bar, and the collapse to a dropdown menu. Thirdly, for the images to be placed in cards, as can be seen on the trainers feature, and lastly for the forms.

1. <a href="https://cdnjs.com/" target="_blank">Cdnjs</a>:
Cdnjs provided the library for the hover over effects on the navigation bar.

1. <a href="https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/" target="_blank"> Ian Lunn's Hover site</a>:
Used this in conjunction with the Cdnjs to pick the right hover effect for my project.

1. <a href="https://www.freeformatter.com/" target="_blank">FreeFormatter</a>:
This technically did not help me create the project, however I used this wesbite to format both my HTML and CSS code. This will make it easier for anyone reading my code in the future.

1. <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a>:
Google Fonts provided the font for my website.

1. <a href="https://fontawesome.com/" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>:
The project uses font awesome icons on the footer, for the social media links.

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
